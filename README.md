# Extended Kalman Filter Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program, Project 1

## Overview
In this project, I utilized a kalman filter using C++ code to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements. 

## Basic Build Instructions
The project has the following dependencies (from Udacity's seed project):

cmake >= 3.5
make >= 4.1
gcc/g++ >= 5.4

To build the project:
1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make` 
   * On windows, you may need to run: `cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles" && make`
4. Run it: `./ExtendedKF `
